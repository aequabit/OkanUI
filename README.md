# Purpose
Okan was built for making the work I put into school projects less redundant. I would often find myself rewriting the UI component for every new project because I wasn't satisfied with the previous one.

# Disclaimer
Okan was designed for small, text-based applications running in a terminal or command prompt, so using it's rendering logic with more complex drawing libraries may significantly impact the performance of your application.

# Rendering
Okan provides a fully functional control-based UI framework for you. Alternatively, you can also build your own and draw it using Okan's standalone rendering component.
